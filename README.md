# Risk of Rain Clone

## Description

This project is my final project for my Unity 1 course at school.

## Important Notice

This game is my first attempt at making a prototype/game in Unity.

Although some of the best practices learned during my course were used, the general lack of experience with the engine and programming would not make this game viable to expand on it to develop a complete product but I learned a lot while developping this prototype.
