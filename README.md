# Risk of Rain Clone

## Description

This project is my final project for my Unity 1 course at school.

## Important Notice

This game is my first attempt at making a prototype/game in Unity and we were tasked with making a game "somewhat" similar to Risk of Rain 2 when it comes to some of the mechanics that we had to implement.

Although some of the best practices learned during my course were used, the general lack of experience with the engine and programming would not make this game viable to expand on it to develop a complete product but I learned a lot while developping this prototype.
